## Project Information
This project was all about creating an Android smartwatch application for the first time (It just so happens that this was also my first ever Android application as well). This went through a few design phases and I learnt a lot from this personal project of mine: 

- How to use Google's GSON library to parse JSON from a web API endpoint
- How to retrieve information from a web API endpoint using the HttpURLConnection class
- How to use the Wearable DataApi to send information between a phone and a smartwatch
- The basics of making a smartwatch app (including app design)
- The concept of a ring buffer
